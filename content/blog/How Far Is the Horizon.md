Standing at the mountain, gazing at the distant line where sky meets the land, most people wonder: _how far am I actually seeing?_ The answer is not just poetic it’s geometric.

### The Horizon and Earth’s Curvature

Because the Earth is round, our view is limited by the curvature of its surface. The horizon is the farthest point you can see before Earth curves away. Interestingly, how far that horizon lies depends on one simple thing: **the height of your eyes above the ground or water.**

### Why a Right Triangle Appears

The geometry becomes clear when we picture Earth as a circle.
- Let the center of Earth be point O
- The radius of Earth is R ≈ 6,371 km
- Your eye, at height h above the surface, is point E. Thus the line OE has length R+h
- The horizon point, where your sightline touches Earth, is H

Here comes the crucial fact from geometry: **a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.**  
Your line of sight EHEH is tangent to Earth’s surface at HH, so:
  
**∠OHE=90∘**

That gives us a right triangle,OHE, with sides:
- OE = R + h (hypotenuse)
- OH = R (one leg)
- EH (the line of sight to horizon, the other leg).

### Deriving the Distance Formula
- From the Pythagorean theorem: **(R + h)^2 = R^2 + (EH)^2**
- Simplifying: **(EH)^2 = 2Rh + h^2**
- Since h ≪ Rh , the term h^2 is tiny compared to 2Rh, so: **EH ≈ sqrt(2Rh)** This gives the straight-line distance to the horizon.

### Converting to a Practical Formula
Plugging in Earth’s radius  **R=6,371 km** = **6,371,000 m** and converting units to make d in kilometers and h in meters This compact equation tells us how far the horizon lies.
**d (km) ≈ 3.57 sqrt( h (m) )**

### The Amazing Takeaway
The horizon isn’t just a vague line — it’s the direct result of geometry. A simple right triangle, formed by your eyes, Earth’s center, and the horizon point, explains what your eyes can (and cannot) see. So next time you’re staring at the horizon, remember: your gaze is brushing a tangent to Earth itself, and the distance is written in mathematics.
